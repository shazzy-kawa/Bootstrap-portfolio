# Bootstrap-portfolio



## Description

In this challenge, I was to create a profile using bootstap. This was a development on the previous profile I had created using grids and flexbox. This was an excellent way of learning how to include different bootstrap components, and how bootstrap can be used to minimise media queries. I have learnt to search online for bootstrap code, how to link bootstrap in my HTML file and how to update these elements in the CSS file. I have also learnt how to inlcude hover and box shadow effects to my hyoerlinks. 


## Usage

The navigation bar directs you to all the appropriate sections in the webpage. All images, outside of the background image in the jumbotron and the small image in the navigation bar, all include alt messages to make the page more accessible. The cards displaying my projects all have buttons that link to their deployed page, except project 4, this current project. In the footer, I have included my contact information. These hyperlinks all include a hover effect. 

Here are some images of the deployed page.
